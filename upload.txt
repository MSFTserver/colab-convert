Install to conda environment:

* twine

    conda install twine

* On Windows install Git together with Bash.


Scripts:

To run the script open Bash terminal, then type <code>. </code> (dot with space), then
drag and drop the script to the Bash terminal (the script will change CWD itself).

* open terminal with activated environment
  * to upload package to pypi change version in `upload`, push changes, run `upload`


Hint: Easily create shortcut to activated environment via Shortcutter:

    # pip install shortcutter
    shortcutter --terminal

* To start Bash on windows type `%b%` in the terminal created via Shortcutter
